# BrainBlitz

This project is an Employee Management System implemented in Python, utilizing the dictionary data structure. It provides various functionalities for managing employee data within an organization.

# Overview
Brain Blitz is a dynamic quiz application for Android that we designed to challenge users with questions from a variety of topics. Users can select their preferred topics and difficulty levels, earning points based on the complexity of the questions they answer. We built this application using Android Studio with Java, leveraging the Open Trivia Database API for sourcing questions and Firebase for user authentication. We also used Firebase Firestore as a database for storing user information.

## Features

### Topic Selection

Users can choose from a wide range of topics, ranging from Art to Politics, allowing for a personalized quiz experience.

### Difficulty Levels

Each topic comes with three difficulty levels; Easy, Medium, and Hard, enabling users to challenge themselves progressively.

### Points System

Points are awarded based on the difficulty of the questions answered correctly. Easy questions are worth 1 point, Medium questions worth 2 points, and Hard questions are worth 3 points, motivating users to tackle harder questions. The points earned in a quiz are added to the users' accumulated points from completing other quizes and is displayed in the Home Activity.

### User Authentication

Secure signup and login functionality powered by Firebase, ensuring a safe and personalized user experience.
